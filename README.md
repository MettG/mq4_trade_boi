# Mq4TradeBoi

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/mq4_trade_boi`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

This gem works as a better interactive server to the MT4 interface. How it works:
    Main.rb is initiated, it looks for a data folder created by the EA, creating a new trade boi instance for each folder
    The EA is intigated, it creates a folder for a specific symbol and time frame, and saves specific data to a file
    Ruby will read the data file, and determine user specified order management (Default is my own order management strategy)
    Ruby is also connected to a slack server and can recieve commands to buy/sell or close trades from anywhere slack recieves data
    Ruby will save all commands to a file, which then the EA reads and performs commands to manage orders
    The EA will save all errors and certains errors will be messaged through the slack to the designated user

    ## Future Updates Will Include ##
        Automated Error Management
        Trade Signals
        Account info data file
        Better info through slack commands

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mq4_trade_boi'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mq4_trade_boi

## Usage

Write your own order management logic in data.rb and specify which data to save in mql4 file_lib.mqh, all mql4 objects are in objects.lib to easily gather data. MAKE SURE TO SPECIFIY WHERE THE DATA IS BEING SAVED (create a new folder called 'data')

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
